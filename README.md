# Iris Perceptron Model

For a class assignment, we were asked to manually develop and train a perceptron learning model on the first 100 classes of the Iris dataset to perform binary classification on future samples.

The model was developed in VSCode using its Jupyter notebook extension. The essential libraries needed are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn.
